# Uber Trip Analysis-Dashboard

## Problem Statement

Uber collects a huge amount of trip data every day from when and where rides are booked, to how long they last, how much they cost, and what type of vehicle is used. But without the right tools, it's hard to turn all that raw data into meaningful insights.

This Power BI dashboard brings everything together in one place. It should help answer questions like: When are people booking the most rides? Which locations have the highest demand? What times of day see the longest trips? And which vehicle types are most popular?

By organizing and visualizing this data, we can spot trends, improve trip efficiency, adjust pricing, and make smarter decisions that benefit both the business and the riders.

### Steps followed 

1- Defined Key Business Metrics (KPIs)
Identified and created measures for crucial KPIs like Total Bookings, Booking Value, Average Booking Value, Trip Distance, and Trip Time to track Uber's core trip performance.

2- Built a Clean, Insightful Overview Dashboard
Designed the Overview Analysis tab to display trends in bookings, revenue, and trip efficiency, supporting executive-level insights.

3-Used a Dynamic Measure Selector
Implemented a disconnected table to let users switch between metrics like Total Bookings, Booking Value, and Trip Distance using a single selector, updating visuals accordingly.

4- Enabled Smart Filtering with Slicers
Added interactive slicers for Date, City, Trip Type (Day/Night), and Payment Type, allowing users to dig deeper into the data.

5- Created Dynamic Titles for Visuals
Titles automatically change based on the selected measure from the dropdown, improving context and clarity for each chart.

6- Enhanced Charts with Custom Tooltips
Tooltips were customized to show additional details such as Average Booking Value and Trip Distance when hovering over visuals.

7- Designed a Vehicle Type Comparison Table
Built a grid (matrix) to compare KPIs across vehicle types, using conditional formatting to highlight performance differences.

8- Mapped Daily Booking Trends
Used line and bar charts to highlight fluctuations in bookings by day, identifying peak and off-peak periods and supporting strategic scheduling.

9- Performed Location-Based Analysis
Visualized Top Pickup & Drop-off Points, Farthest Trips, and Top 5 Locations by bookings to understand spatial patterns and optimize driver placement.
